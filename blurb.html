In case you have any queries or concerns regarding the queries asked above, please feel free to write back to me, it would be my pleasure to assist you further and ushering your issue towards resolution.
                
In the meanwhile, I'll be changing the status of this case to 'Pending Amazon Action' while we wait for a response from the internal team. This is to avoid the case from automatically resolving.

Please be assured that I am here to help and my intentions will always be addressing your case in the best way possible, looking for your needs to be covered and accomplish your satisfaction.However, in case this information does not cover your concern or if you have any further questions please do not hesitate in reaching back to me over this case, I'll be happy to work until everything is resolved/addressed successfully.

Having said that, I would like to inform you that CloudWatch is a push based service / CloudWatch is a service which only accepts metric; i.e. it only consumes information. CloudWatch plays no role in pushing the metrics (it does not pull metrics from the source AWS service) and it is the source AWS service (in this case Amazon ApiGateway) that is responsible to push the metrics to CloudWatch. Please feel free to reach out to the Amazon ApiGateway team via support case as they will be in a better position to assist you with queries related to Amazon ApiGateway metrics. I hope you understand.

As CloudWatch is a push-based service, we do not have visibility at the source performing the logging on the respective log groups and we cannot limit how much logs you are pushing to CloudWatch using "PutLogEvents". To reduce the Log ingestion costs, I'll recommend you re-evaluate logging levels at the source that is ingesting the logs to CloudWatch and reduce / eliminate the ingestion of unnecessary logs according to your use-case.
                
In case I was able to address all your concerns, please let me know so that I could mark this case as "Resolved" on behalf of you for your kind convenience.
                
As discussed, you did mentioned you were happy with the outcome of the call and we could RESOLVE the case. That being said, I will be administratively resolving the case as the IT service has been fully restored and operational.

--------
I hope I was able to help clarify all your concerns regarding this case. Since you did not seem to have any further queries on our Live Chat earlier today, I shall go ahead and mark this case as "Resolved" as per your kind consent.
Please feel free to reach out to us again if you come across any further concerns.

It was indeed my pleasure to work with you on the case.
Wishing you a wonderful day ahead!

Awaiting your kind response. Wishing you an AWSome day ahead!

However, in case the issue still persists, or if you are unable to follow any of the steps provided, or if your use case is different, we could possibly try to troubleshoot this over a Chime Meeting with a screen sharing session to try and resolve this issue at the earliest. 
Kindly let me know if you are able to provide a time slot for your availability from Monday to Friday, 7:30AM to 4:30PM UTC so that I could assist you over the screenshare on the Chime Meeting. 

In case, no time slots are available between my aforementioned shift timings, you may also consider initiating a Live Chat/Call Support with us through your Amazon Case Console and the next available engineer should be able to assist you over the Chime session.

Looking forward to your kind response. Wish you a wonderful day ahead!
