As CloudWatch is a push-based service, we do not have visibility at the source performing the logging on the respective log groups and we cannot limit how much logs you are pushing to CloudWatch using "PutLogEvents". To reduce the Log ingestion costs, I'll recommend you re-evaluate logging levels at the source that is ingesting the logs to CloudWatch and reduce / eliminate the ingestion of unnecessary logs according to your use-case.
                
In case I was able to address all your concerns, please let me know so that I could mark this case as "Resolved" on behalf of you for your kind convenience.
                
Awaiting your kind response. Wishing you an AWSome day ahead!
